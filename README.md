# 🧠 Tokenization Fundamentals in NLP

This is a simple yet powerful notebook that explores **tokenization** – the very first step in any NLP pipeline. Built with Python on Google Colab, it breaks down how machines convert text into a format they can understand and work with.

## 🔍 What's inside
- Using Python's built-in `ord()` function to explore character encoding
- Understanding Unicode values and their role in tokenization
- Basic token splitting techniques
- Foundation for more advanced NLP tasks like embeddings and transformers

## 🚀 Why it matters
Tokenization is the starting point of everything in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Whether you're training a sentiment model or building a chatbot, how you break down text defines your entire pipeline.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- Basic NLP concepts
- Unicode processing

## 📈 Next Steps
This project is part of my journey toward mastering NLP. Future notebooks will cover:
- Word embeddings
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Transformer-based models (e.g. BERT, GPT)
